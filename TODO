[Users]
- Do the feature

[Pictures]
- Do the feature (merge the Video/Pictures feature? i.e. for personal holiday data sharing...)

[Database]
- When removing a track, make sure to remove genre/artist/release if last
- Use Inotify like system to watch modified/added files
- Implement a video database cleanup
- User access for Video/Pictures  (really needed for Audio?)

[Audio]
- TableViewFilter: <All> -> Track count for this speccial category
- MediaPlayer: move slider using js
- TrackView : handle original release date
- TrackView : handle duration > 1 hour
- TrackView : select only relevant columns to speed up queries (do not get eveything)
- OGG metadata -> properly handle metadata nested in the audio stream

[Remote API]
- Think about a remote API to get/retrieve transcoded files (i.e. for mobile apps)?

[Layout]
- Make it mobile browser compatible
- Style eveything nicely...
