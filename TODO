[ServiceManager]
- Rework the whole start/stop/try/cach/thread/interrupts things
- Use our own WIOService

[Services]
- consider using external web server instead of builtin httpd (new FCGI service?)

[Users]
- Handle login lifetime?
- Limit multi login from UI and remote interfaces (limit per interface is acceptable)

[Cover]
- Scaling: find something more "reliable" than GIL and its customs extensions (adobe work, io_new)?

[Database]
- Optim, use SQL query to get genre orphans
- Use Inotify like system to watch modified/added files?
- Implement a video database cleanup
- Group videos in "video groups". Each video may has sub groups (current "Path" class)
	-> Simplify the database and remove the Path class
- Process only files whose extensions are well known in audio/video world (avoid useless parsing/errors)?
- make a default admin/admin account of the very first connection?

[Metadata]

[Transcode]
- some early playback end spotted on flac files or huge audio files (> several hours)
- limit transcode bitrate to the media bitrate (no need to upscale)

[UI]
	- handle internationalization
	- make a wizard on first connection (or make a default admin/admin account of the very first connection)?
	[Settings]
		- increase the menu's width
		- logout users that are being changed (loss of admin admin rights), or make sure they are still admin when they make changes
		- "signal not exposed" problem if a user logout and login again. bad resource destruction?
		[user/transcoding]
		- Prefered codecs for audio/video?
		[admin/Users]
		- do not activate the update period/start time when 'admin' is checked
		[admin/Database update]
		- do not make the update start time field active when update perdiod is "Never"
		- refresh the audio/video view when the database directories have been updated

	[Audio]
	- Style eveything nicely...
	- Search patterns in the genre list
	- ReleaseView/ArtistView/GenreView: <All> -> Track count for this special category. Easier: add a special entry '<All>' that contains everything?
	- MediaPlayer: move slider using js (http://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/boards/2/topics/7924?r=8478)
	- TrackView : handle original release date
	- TrackView : handle duration > 1 hour
	- TrackView : select only relevant columns to speed up queries (do not get eveything)
	- TrackView : Reselect the current selected item when displaying the updated search results
	- ReleaseView: display the original release's publication year
	- OGG metadata -> properly handle metadata nested in the audio stream
	- Filters: use directly the id as constraint, instead of the name?
	- Implement a playlist:
		- Drag and drop all objets from the views (genre, artist, release, track) in the playlist?
		- Add 'play/add last' button on mouse hover?
		- Save/Load playlists?

	[Video]
	- View the Videos in a WtTableView ?
	- Use Groups/SubGroups to organize videos (WTreeView?)

	[Layout]
	- Make it mobile browser compatible
	- Style eveything nicely...
	- Handle internal path

[Remote API]
- Implement text search options in the GetXXX messages
- Implement genre id filters for Artist/Release
- Rework the media API (use a handle)

[Logs]
- Use a logging facility
