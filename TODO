[Book]
- Make the feature

[Cover]
- Handle preferred cover file names
- Implement a cache and a grabber from some web service (mandatory for artists)

[Database]
- Optim, use SQL query to get the "genre" orphans
- Use Inotify like system to watch modified/added files?
- handle access rights problems (instead of aborting)
- add a global play counter for tracks. This will help people to spot most popular files
- rework the exception process in av/metadata/updater in case of bad files
- Use the WServer::post method to notify the end of the database scan? (with results?)
- Put more config information in the database, access from the UI

[Metadata]
- OGG metadata -> properly handle metadata nested in the audio stream

[Playlist]
- Make public playlists so that users can see what other people are listening to

[Users]
- Handle login lifetime?
- Use the WServer::post method to kick users already logged in?
- Limit multi login from UI and API interfaces (limit per interface is acceptable)

[Services]
- consider adding support for external web servers (new FCGI service?)

[UI]
	- handle internationalization
	[Settings]
		- logout users that are being changed (loss of admin admin rights), or make sure they are still admin when they make changes
		- "signal not exposed" problem if a user logout and login again. Bad resource destruction?
		- add a scroll area in order for settings to work on mobile devices
		[user/transcoding]
		- Prefered codecs for video
		- use a slider instead of a combo box for the bitrates?
		[admin/Users]
		- do not activate the update period/start time when 'admin' is checked
		- do not activate the bitrate limit when creating a new admin user
		[admin/Database update]
		- do not make the update start time field active when update perdiod is "Never"
		- refresh the audio/video view when the database directories have been updated

	[Audio]

	- Make a dedicated audio layout in mobile environment (keep the same layout for videos?)
	- Handle internal path
