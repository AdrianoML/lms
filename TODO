[ServiceManager]
- Rework the whole start/stop/try/cach/thread/interrupts things
- Use our own WIOService

[Services]
- consider adding support for external web servers (new FCGI service?)

[Users]
- Handle login lifetime?
- Limit multi login from UI and remote interfaces (limit per interface is acceptable)

[Cover]
- Scaling: find something more "reliable" than GIL and its custom extensions (adobe work, io_new)?
- Get the cover from image files in the same folder ("cover.jpg", etc.)

[Database]
- Optim, use SQL query to get the "genre" orphans
- Use Inotify like system to watch modified/added files?
- count scan import errors

[Metadata]
- OGG metadata -> properly handle metadata nested in the audio stream

[Transcode]
- some early end of playback spotted on flac files. Spotted on old firefox versions?

[UI]
	- handle internationalization
	[Settings]
		- logout users that are being changed (loss of admin admin rights), or make sure they are still admin when they make changes
		- "signal not exposed" problem if a user logout and login again. Bad resource destruction?
		[user/transcoding]
		- Prefered codecs for video
		- use a slider instead of a combo box for the bitrates?
		[admin/Users]
		- do not activate the update period/start time when 'admin' is checked
		- do not activate the bitrate limit when creating a new admin user
		[admin/Database update]
		- do not make the update start time field active when update perdiod is "Never"
		- refresh the audio/video view when the database directories have been updated

	[Audio]
	- Style eveything nicely...
	- MediaPlayer: move the slider using js (http://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/boards/2/topics/7924?r=8478)
	- TrackView : handle durations > 1 hour
	- TrackView : Reselect the current selected item when displaying the updated search results
	- Add covers in the release filter?
	- Add a download button to get the current playlist in a streamed zip file
	- Add a upload button to upload media files in a dedicated directory
	- Add keyboard shortcuts

	[Video]
	- implement a decent mediaplayer
	- remove codec choice from parameters

	[Layout]
	- Style eveything nicely...
	- Make a dedicated audio layout in mobile environment (keep the same layout for videos?)
	- Handle internal path

[Remote API]
- Implement partial text search options in the GetXXX messages

[REST API]
- Make another dedicated REST API. Maybe use the SubSonic API?

[Logs]
- Capture transcoder log output to get more information on errors
