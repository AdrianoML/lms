[Book]
- Make the feature?

[Build]
- Makefile per directory. Use the include flags only where needed?

[Cover]
- Handle preferred cover file names ("front.xxx", "cover.xxx", ...)
- Implement a cache and a grabber from some web service (mandatory for artists?)

[Database]
- Optim, use SQL query to get the "genre" orphans
- Use Inotify like system to watch modified/added files?
- handle access rights problems (instead of aborting)
- add a global play counter for tracks. This will help people to spot most popular files
- rework the exception process in av/metadata/updater in case of bad files
- Use the WServer::post method to notify the end of the database scan? (with results?)

[Metadata]
- OGG metadata -> properly handle metadata nested in the audio stream

[Playlist]
- Make public playlists so that users can see what other people are listening to

[Users]
- Handle login lifetime?
- Use the WServer::post method to kick users already logged in?
- Limit multi login from UI and API interfaces (limit per interface is acceptable)

[Services]
- consider adding support for external web servers (new FCGI service?)

[UI]
	- Handle internationalization
	- Handle internal path
	- Cannot log again when refreshing the application in firefox (have to close/open a new browser tab)
	[Settings]
		- logout users that are being changed (loss of admin rights), or make sure they are still admin when they make changes
		- "signal not exposed" problem if a user logout and login again. Bad resource destruction?
		- add a scroll area in order for settings to work on mobile devices
		[user/transcoding]
		- Prefered codecs for video
		- use a slider instead of a combo box for the bitrates?
		[admin/Users]
		- do not activate the update period/start time when 'admin' is checked
		- do not activate the bitrate limit when creating a new admin user
		[admin/Database update]
		- do not make the update start time field active when update perdiod is "Never"
		- refresh the audio/video view when the database directories have been updated

	[Audio]
		- drop the winamp like interface?
		- Add a download button to get the current playlist in a streamed zip file
		- Add a upload button to upload media files in a dedicated directory
		- Perform a search for each key pressed (using a timer, in JS)
		- Save user prefs in local storage (volume, loop, shuffle, current playqueue, etc.)
		[desktop]
		- TrackView: Reselect the current selected item when displaying the updated search results
		- Add keyboard shortcuts
		- playqueue: try to get a single div to display the cover / artist / track name in order to improve style
		[mobile]
		- Reorganize the views to ease internal paths
		- Covers not always the same height
		- 'duration' and 'play' tags are broken if title is too long
		- Cover loading breaks the vertical alignment
		- Implement a play queue
		- Implement a decent player
		- Make the release/artist clickable when displayed to the user

	[Video]
	- implement a decent mediaplayer
	- remove codec choice from parameters

[REST API]
- Make a dedicated REST API. Maybe use the SubSonic API or Ampache API?

[Logs]
- Capture transcoder log output to get more information on errors?
