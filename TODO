[ServiceManager]
- Rework the whole start/stop/try/cach/thread/interrupts things
- Rework the io_service thread pool thing
	- Use our own WIOService

[Services]
- [UI] generate argc/argv from a config file (crypto, port info, db path)
- [Remote] use config file to get crypto, port info, db path
- consider using external web server instead of builtin httpd (new FCGI service?)

[Users]
- Handle login lifetime?
- Limit multi login from UI and remote interface (limit per interface is OK)

[Cover]
- Scaling: find something more "reliable" than GIL and its customs extensions (adobe work, io_new)?

[Database]
- Remove Audio/Video distinction
- When removing a track, make sure to remove genre/artist/release if last of it
- Use Inotify like system to watch modified/added files?
- Implement a video database cleanup
- Group video in "video groups". Each video may has sub groups (current "Path" class)
	-> Simplify database and remove the Path class
- Use size limits for strings (artist, release, genre)?
- Process only files whose extensions are well known in audio/video world (avoid useless parsing/errors)

[Transcode]
- some zombies seem to be remaining after a week of use
- some early playback end spotted on flac files

[UI]
	[Settings]
		- logout users that are being changed (loss of admin admin rights), or make sure they are still admin when they make changes
		- "signal not exposed" problem if a user logout and login again. bad resource destruction?
		[admin/DB]
		- Add a dedicated Menu to add/delete and view the Media pathes (see Users for the idea)
		- Do not make the update start time field active when update perdiod is "Never"
		- Do not restart the db update service if user applied no changes
		- Uncheck the "Request immediate scan" once setins are applied
		[user/transcoding]
		- Prefered codecs for audio/video?

	[Audio]
	- ReleaseView/ArtistView/GenreView: <All> -> Track count for this special category. Easier: add a special entry '<All>' that contains everything?
	- MediaPlayer: move slider using js (http://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/boards/2/topics/7924?r=8478)
	- TrackView : handle original release date
	- TrackView : handle duration > 1 hour
	- TrackView : select only relevant columns to speed up queries (do not get eveything)
	- TrackView : Reselect the current selected item when displaying the updated search results
	- ReleaseView: display the release's publication year
	- OGG metadata -> properly handle metadata nested in the audio stream
	- TrackView : when udating the view, reselect the current playing track
	- Filters: use directly the id as constraint, instead of the name?
	- Implement a playlist:
	- Drag and drop all objets from the views (genre, artist, release, track) in the playlist?
	- Add 'play/add last' button on mouse hover?
	- Save/Load playlists?

	[Video]
	- View the Videos in a WtTableView ?
	- Use Groups/SubGroups to organize videos (WTreeView?)

	[Layout]
	- Make it mobile browser compatible
	- Style eveything nicely...
	- Handle internal path

[Remote API]
- Implement text search options in the GetXXX messages

[Logs]
- Use a logging facility
