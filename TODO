[ServiceManager]
- Rework the whole start/stop/try/cach/thread/interrupts things
- Rework the io_service thread pool thing

[Services]
- [UI] generate argc/argv from a config file (crypto, port info, db path)
- [Remote] use config file to get crypto, port info, db path
- consider using external web server instead of builtin httpd (new FCGI service?)

[Settings]
- [admin] Add/remove users
	- max audio/video bitrates for user
	- capabilities
- [admin] Add path to Audio/Video files
- [admin] Manual/autorefresh settings
- [admin] Display some stats about the database:
	- nb audio/video files
	- last scan/update
- Prefered bitrate and codecs for audio/video

[Users]
- Handle login lifetime?
- Disable multi login?

[Cover]
- Scaling: find something more "reliable" than GIL and its customs extensions (adobe work, io_new)?

[Database]
- Remove Audio/Video distinction
- When removing a track, make sure to remove genre/artist/release if last of it
- Use Inotify like system to watch modified/added files?
- Implement a video database cleanup
- Group video in "video groups". Each video may has sub groups (current "Path" class)
	-> Simplify database and remove the Path class
- Use size limits for strings (artist, release, genre)?
- Process only files whose extensions are well known in audio/video world (avoid useless parsing/errors)

[Audio]
- ReleaseView/ArtistView/GenreView: <All> -> Track count for this special category. Easier: add a special entry '<All>' that contains everything?
- MediaPlayer: move slider using js (http://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/boards/2/topics/7924?r=8478)
- TrackView : handle original release date
- TrackView : handle duration > 1 hour
- TrackView : select only relevant columns to speed up queries (do not get eveything)
- TrackView : Reselect the current playing song when displaying the updated search results
- ReleaseView: display the release's publication year
- OGG metadata -> properly handle metadata nested in the audio stream
- TrackView : when udating the view, reselect the current playing track
- Filters: use directly the id as constraint, instead of the name?
- Implement a playlist:
	- Drag and drop all objets from the views (genre, artist, release, track) in the playlist?
	- Add 'play/add last' button on mouse hover?
	- Save/Load playlists?

[Video]
- View the Videos in a WtTableView ?
	- Use Groups/SubGroups to organize videos (WTreeView?)

[Remote API]
- Implement text search options in the GetXXX messages

[Layout]
- Make it mobile browser compatible
- Style eveything nicely...

[Logs]
- Use a logging facility
