I) DEPENCIES

libboost-dev libextractor-dev libavcodec-dev libwt-dev libprotobuf-dev libconfig++-dev

Warning: your distrib may provide an outdated wt library. Using the latest Wt (>= 3.3.3) is highly recommended (http://www.webtoolkit.eu/wt)


II) BUILD

# autoreconf -vfi
# mkdir build
# cd build
# ../configure

(configure will complain if a mandatory library is missing)

# make -j 4


III) Setting up SSL (required by the Remote mobile service and the web server)

Just an example, you could do whatever you want (ca, self signed cert, etc.)

Generate a dh file:
# openssl dhparam -out dh2048.pem 2048

Generate a self signed certificate:
# openssl req -x509 -out cert.pem -keyout privkey.pem -newkey rsa:4096


IV) RUNNING

In the build directory:
# ./lms lms.conf

Create the lms.conf file using the etc/lms.sample.conf

Depending of your SSL parameters, you may be asked for the PEM passphrase to unlock the private key.
